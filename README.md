The Wisconsin breast cancer dataset contains characteristics of the cell nuclei and has a target class of two classes - Benign and Malginant.
Following are theinput and target variables :

ID number
Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

In this project we will build two classification models - Logisitic regression and random forest which will take in the input features and output the classification results."
